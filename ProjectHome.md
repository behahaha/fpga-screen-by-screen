Our goal is a make a variety of retro mini games using the Altera II DE2 Board. These games will consist of a player-versus-environment (PvE), player-versus-player (PvP), and a maze as well as a basic splash screen.

We will be using John Loomis's VGA controller with heavy modification in some areas, we will also be using University of Toronto's PS2 keyboard module in a mostly unmodified state.
